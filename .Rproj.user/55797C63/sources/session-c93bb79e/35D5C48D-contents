Description: In situations where a control group is unavailable, conventional counterfactual methodologies for causal panel analysis 
    are not applicable. This R package implements the Machine Learning Control Method (MLCM), a novel technique that leverages 
    counterfactual forecasting through machine learning. The package allows researchers to estimate various policy-relevant 
    causal parameters like the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in both short 
    and long-panel settings, even in the absence of control units as described in Cerqua, Letta & Menchetti (2023)
